        <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, 
            is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped 
            face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

        <h2 id="Game">Goals</h2> 
        <p>This game may sound like it is easy, but it can get difficult really fast when the number of cards is increased.
            Imagine a game of nooose and give yourself a lifecount for mistakes. Try and compete and become better. This 
            came is ultimately worth more than the satisfaction of winning, because you will also be improving your memory 
            along the way.</p>
